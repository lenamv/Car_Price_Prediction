# Car Prices Prediction

The project is created to automate process of estimation of used car price based on set of its features.  It is supposed to be used by a company that specialized in selling used cars. The dataset was provided by SuperDataScience platform.  

A nonlinear regression model was built using Support Vector Regression (SVR) with 'rbf' kernel. Mean squared error (ùëÄùëÜùê∏) and coefficient of determination (R2 score) were used as the performance metrics. The result model R2 score was around of 91%.
